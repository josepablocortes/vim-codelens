## Purpose

vim-codelens is a neovim plugin somewhat inspired by Visual Studio codelens.
At the moment it has very few features. The main one being to provide virtualtext against a function definition indicating when
it was last modified, by who, and how many people have edited it. At the moment, during this experimental testing
phase it only works with Clojure and VimScript functions.
