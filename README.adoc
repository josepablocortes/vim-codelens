== Warning

This is a very, very rough proof of concept, it might break, or produce errors that interrupt your workflow. It is currently working well for me.

== Purpose

vim-codelens is a neovim plugin somewhat inspired by Visual Studio codelens.

At the moment it has very few features. The main one being to provide virtualtext against a function definition indicating when
it was last modified, by who, and how many people have edited it.

== Features

The features provided by codelens vary based on the `filetype` of the current buffer. The basic features are as follow:

1. Provides the author name and date of most recent git modification at the top of the current file

There are additional features for Clojure, vim, javascript, terraform, python, and hug sql file types.

1. Provides the author name and date of most recent git modification for the current function, class, namespace etc.
2. Provides a count of the number of references to the current function, class, namespace etc.
3. Provides a count of the number of tests of the current function, class, namespace etc.
